# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix GPT response parsing logic in frontend





  - Modify the response parsing logic in `handleGPTStream` function to correctly extract response content
  - Remove the incorrect `data.data?.response` fallback that causes empty responses
  - Update the response extraction to use only `data.response` from the backend API
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4_
-

- [x] 2. Improve error handling and user feedback




  - Enhance error messages to be more user-friendly and descriptive
  - Add specific handling for different error types (network, HTTP, empty response)
  - Update error message display to provide clear guidance to users
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
-

- [x] 3. Add comprehensive debugging and logging




  - Enhance debug logging to show the actual response structure received from backend
  - Add logging for response parsing steps to help troubleshoot future issues
  - Include response data structure in debug logs for better visibility
  - _Requirements: 1.2_




- [ ] 4. Test the streaming functionality

  - Verify that the streaming effect works correctly with the fixed response parsing
  - Ensure that long responses are displayed smoothly character by character
  - Test that streaming completes properly and shows the full response
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate fix with different response scenarios
  - Test with normal GPT responses to ensure content displays correctly
  - Test with empty responses to verify fallback message works
  - Test with error responses to ensure proper error handling
  - Test with various response lengths to verify streaming performance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.3, 3.2_
